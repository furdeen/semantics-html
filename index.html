            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Tim Berners Lee dreamt of a World Wide Web that would be free and accessible to everyone. Sadly, the modern web is littered with
            poorly designed websites and difficult to navigate code (for both developers and users). This often comes down to a lack of
            understanding around different user needs.</p>
            <p>Designing pages that are accessible for everyone shouldn’t be too difficult. The developers at Tech Returners News have collated an
                ‘easy wins' checklist for Web page accessibility.</p><br><br>
                <p>Keep this guide handy... When creating your own websites you can check these criteria off the list!</p>

            <h3>Accessibility Checks:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Heading elements & Page Titles: HTML heading elements have been used to represent page structure, supporting assistive
                    technologies that allow page navigation from heading to heading.</li>
                <li>Re-size Text: You can vary text size by using your browser's text resize settings (through Options or Preferences),
                    text-only zoom, page zoom (which also zooms images, buttons etc) without incurring styling issues / text over-lapping or being cut off the page.</li>
                    <li>Alternative text for images: All images have been given appropriate alternative text.</li>
                    <li>Link text: All hyperlinks should make sense when read out of context, and hyperlinks are clearly presented in a different text style from
                        normal body text. If a link opens in a new browser page, it has been labelled as doing so.</li>
                        <li>JavaScript independence: Where JavaScript or other scripts are used for navigation or functionality, an alternative mechanism has been
                            put in place in case your browser does not support these scripts.</li>
                            <li>Colour contrast: has been checked for text and background colour combinations to ensure that the contrast is sufficient and I have also
                                ensured that information is not referenced by colour alone.</li>
                                <li>Style sheets: If style sheets are not supported or are turned off, information on the site can still be accessed and read.</li>
                                <li>Forms: forms are marked up correctly so people can interact with them using only the keyboard, voice input or screen readers. The form
                                    labels themselves are clickable, increasing the target area and making it easier to select small radio buttons of checkboxes.</li>
